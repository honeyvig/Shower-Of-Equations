# Shower-Of-Equations
Hereâ€™s an example Python script that randomly generates and displays algebraic equations (linear, quadratic, or simple arithmetic expressions) and displays them in a "shower" or loop-style output:
Python Code for Shower of Random Equations

import random
import time

# Function to generate random linear equation (Ax + B = C)
def generate_linear_equation():
    A = random.randint(1, 10)
    B = random.randint(0, 10)
    C = random.randint(0, 20)
    equation = f"{A}x + {B} = {C}"
    return equation

# Function to generate random quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0)
def generate_quadratic_equation():
    A = random.randint(1, 5)
    B = random.randint(-10, 10)
    C = random.randint(-10, 10)
    equation = f"{A}x^2 + {B}x + {C} = 0"
    return equation

# Function to generate random simple arithmetic expression (A + B, A - B, A * B, A / B)
def generate_arithmetic_expression():
    A = random.randint(1, 10)
    B = random.randint(1, 10)
    operator = random.choice(['+', '-', '*', '/'])
    
    # Avoid division by zero
    if operator == '/' and B == 0:
        B = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    expression = f"{A} {operator} {B}"
    return expression

# Function to simulate the "shower" of equations
def shower_of_equations(duration=10):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    while time.time() - start_time < duration:
        # Randomly pick a type of equation to generate
        equation_type = random.choice(['linear', 'quadratic', 'arithmetic'])
        
        if equation_type == 'linear':
            equation = generate_linear_equation()
        elif equation_type == 'quadratic':
            equation = generate_quadratic_equation()
        else:
            equation = generate_arithmetic_expression()

        # Display the equation
        print(f"Equation: {equation}")
        
        # Wait for a short time before generating the next one
        time.sleep(0.5)

# Example usage: Run the "shower of equations" for 10 seconds
shower_of_equations(duration=10)

Explanation:

    Equation Types:
        Linear Equation: Ax + B = C, where A, B, and C are randomly generated integers.
        Quadratic Equation: Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0, where A, B, and C are randomly generated integers.
        Arithmetic Expression: A simple arithmetic expression with two numbers and a random operator (+, -, *, /).

    shower_of_equations Function:
        The function runs for a specified duration (default is 10 seconds) and generates a random equation every half second.
        It randomly selects from the three types of equations (linear, quadratic, arithmetic) and prints them out.

    Output:
        The output will be a continuous "shower" of equations that appear one after another for the specified duration.

Example Output:

Equation: 9x + 8 = 13
Equation: 5x^2 + 6x + 2 = 0
Equation: 3 * 8
Equation: 7x + 9 = 16
Equation: 8x^2 + 3x + 7 = 0
Equation: 4 + 5
Equation: 6x + 7 = 14
Equation: 3 * 6
...

Customization:

    You can modify the duration of the "shower" by changing the duration parameter.
    You can extend the functionality by adding more types of equations, adjusting the range of random values, or formatting the output differently.

This script is useful for quickly generating a variety of equations for practice, testing, or educational purposes.
